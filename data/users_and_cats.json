He also is addicted to dehydrated chicken, and screams to be fed his dinner 2 hours early. Meow was born a male but due to a urethra defect he had to have a $6k operation that made him have female anatomy. We told Meow to pick their new pronouns, but they are still deciding. It’s been 2 years, we are hoping they choose soon.",

That one’s just too damn yummy.), helping Mom make the bed, putting my pipe cleaners in the water bowl, getting all the belly rubs, and practicing my meows constantly, now that I have finally found my voice. My brother loves bossing me (and everyone else) around (Even though he’s literally almost half my size), hanging out in the catio, yelling at Mom when dinner’s late, bossing me around some more, and snuggles from Mom and Dad, but mainly Dad. We have them well trained.",

        "bio": "I've never been a cat person, but my kids had been begging for one for quite some time- an orange one specifically. My daughter even went as far as to make me a PowerPoint presentation about why we should get one. I kept making excuses hoping they'd forget about it and realize it's never going to happen. Then covid hit and we were all stuck at home...and low and behold, my friend's kiddo found an
        ice chest on the side of the road full of orange kittens along with their mom that were in need of adoption. I took it as a sign from the universe that it was time for us to get a cat.
        Growing up, we had a dog that was found in a dumpster that we named Rolf. Keeping with the theme of abandoned animals found in weird places and naming pets after characters in the Muppets, we decided to name our kitty Kermit. Nicknames are Kermie, Mau, and Kermalongadingdong.
        Kermit is the most loving, snuggling, and affectionate cat ever. He likes to nurse on my earlobes and loves me the most (although he loves my kids too.) He seldom meows and loves to watch birds from the window and take lots of cat naps throughout the day.
        The best part is getting to witness my children love on this little furrball. He really completes our family unit and I will fully admit I'm now the crazy cat lady I swore I'd never be, and I couldn't be more happy about it.",
