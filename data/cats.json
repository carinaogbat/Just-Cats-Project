His hobbies include getting trapped in the freezer, stealing straws out of your drinks, sniffing candles, slapping the dog in the ass, and knocking everything off the counters. He also is addicted to dehydrated chicken, and screams to be fed his dinner 2 hours early. Meow was born a male but due to a urethra defect he had to have a $6k operation that made him have female anatomy. We told Meow to pick their new pronouns, but they are still deciding. It’s been 2 years, we are hoping they choose soon."

My hobbies are eating that one plant of Dad’s in the corner of the living room (I leave the other ones alone. That one’s just too damn yummy.), helping Mom make the bed, putting my pipe cleaners in the water bowl, getting all the belly rubs, and practicing my meows constantly, now that I have finally found my voice. My brother loves bossing me (and everyone else) around (Even though he’s literally almost half my size), hanging out in the catio, yelling at Mom when dinner’s late, bossing me around some more, and snuggles from Mom and Dad, but mainly Dad. We have them well trained."
